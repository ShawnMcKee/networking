### Multiple NIC (Network Interface Card) Guidance

The OSG and WLCG recommendation is to deploy two flavors of perfSONAR measurement nodes: 1) a latency instance which continuously measures packet delay and lost and 2) a bandwidth instance measuring
the achievable bandwidth.  That implies sites must purchase, deploy and maintain two systems.  **Why can't we just run both latency and bandwidth services on a single instance?**
The problem is that running both latency and bandwidth services on a single node / single NIC may cause interence between the various measurements and introduce "false-positive" indications of
network problems.    

Many sites would prefer **not** to have to deploy two servers for cost, space and power reasons.  Fortunately the perfSONAR developers have provided a way to install both latency and bandwidth

measurements services on a single node, as long as it has at least two NICs (one per 'flavor' of measurement) and sufficient processing and memory.  See [manage-dual-xface](http://docs.perfsonar.net/manage_dual_xface.html) for details on configuring this.

Here we discuss the requirements and implications of deploying a perfSONAR server with multiple NICs.
